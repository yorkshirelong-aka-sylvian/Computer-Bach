# Computer-Bach
A synthesiser instrument based on the Creativitas platform by Ian Hattwick and Tone.js project on github.

This is the project continuing in Prof. Ian Hattwick's Collaborative-Music-Lab. 
To run the code, please copy and paste the code in https://ianhattwick.com/creativitas

The basic idea is to generate random baroque melodies out of expr() function and user created patterns.
