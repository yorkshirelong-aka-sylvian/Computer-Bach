# Computer-Bach
A synthesiser instrument based on the Creativitas platform by Ian Hattwick and Tone.js project on github.

This is the project continuing in Prof. Ian Hattwick's Collaborative-Music-Lab. 
To run the code, please copy and paste the code in https://ianhattwick.com/creativitas

The basic idea is to generate random baroque melodies out of expr() function and user created patterns.

Here's the initial design of the instrument:

The two Faders on the top left controls two randomly generated melodies (Bass and Soprano). Thanks to the integers kind to numbers representing the notes, the melodies will always in the selected keys.

The two Faders on the top right controls two drum lines, currently one bass and one snare. We use a brand new way to control the Drum: you may choose the drum loop by faders. This gives a lot of possibilities for creative composition.

### Prototype UI1

The faders are the same as in the initial design. The knob between the two faders controls the current Key, in a 5th progression.

The X-Y pad below the knob controls the cutoff and delay of the instrument (not the drum).

The two buttons in the second line are NOT WORKING currently, but we are fixing this to make it able to choose present instruments.

### Prototype UI2

Unfortunately the two buttons are still NOT WORKING

WARNING: The intensity of sound is not balanced
